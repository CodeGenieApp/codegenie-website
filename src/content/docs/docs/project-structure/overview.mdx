description: High-level overview of the project structure

Code Genie projects are monorepos that include everything you need to deploy a full stack, Serverless, Cloud Native application. Packages for the frontend, backend, infrastructure (IAC), and other supporting packages exist within the top-level `/packages` directory.

All packages are written using Typescript and Node.js, with ESLint and Jest being used for linting and testing respectively.

This guide will familiarize software developers with the project structure so that they can quickly start developing their application. Below is a high-level view of the overall project structure. In the following guides we'll dive deeper into each individual package.

## Frontend (UI)

The frontend is a React Next.js Single Page Application (SPA) that uses the Ant Design component library and is hosted on AWS Amplify Hosting.

Read the [Frontend project structure guide](./frontend-ui.md) for more information.

## Backend/API

The backend is an Express REST API hosted on AWS Lambda and API Gateway, utilizing the popular [@codegenie/serverless-express](https://github.com/brettstack/code-genie) package.

Read the [Backend project structure guide](./backend-api.md) for more information.

## Database

The database uses AWS DynamoDB, with [DynamoDB Toolbox](https://github.com/dynamodb-toolbox) used as the client library for querying and mutating data.

Read the [Database project structure guide](./database.md) for more information.

## Auth/Identity

User Identity/Auth is managed via an AWS Cognito User Pool. Currently only email registration is supported out-of-the-box, with SSO (social signin and SAML) support coming soon. For now, developers can implement SSO themselves by following the[Adding social identity providers to a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-social-idp.html) AWS guide.

Read the [Auth/Identity guide](./auth-identity.md) for more information.

## Cloud Infrastructure

All cloud infrastructure is defined as IAC (Infrastructure as Code) using AWS CDK. This enables developers to easily create new and consistent environments for prod, staging, and individual developer instances.

Read the [Cloud Infrastructure guide](./cloud-infrastructure.md) for more information.

## Github Workflows (CI/CD)

A Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is built using GitHub Actions/Workflows

## Miscellaneous (Everything else)

Other packages such not covered in other sections (such as `common` and `utils`) are covered in the [Miscellaneous](./miscellaneous) guide.
