description: Get Started with Code Genie
---

This guide will walk you through how to generate your first application with Code Genie, deploy it to your AWS Account, and run it locally for development.

## Prerequisites

- [AWS Account + CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/setup-aws-cli.html)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)

## Download example

*Coming Soon:* Download and unzip example project directory

```
Curl + unzip + CD commands
```

## Install dependencies and generate app

*Coming Soon:* Self-service generation is still under development. Until then, contact brett@codegenie.codes with your data model to generate your project source code.

<!-- ```
npm i
npm run codegenie:generate
``` -->

## Deploy developer instance

See the `README.md` in your application's project for further instructions.

<!-- ```
npm run codegenie:setup
``` -->

## Run local developer environment

See the `README.md` in your application's project for further instructions.

<!-- ```
npm run start:api
```

```
npm run start:ui:offline
``` -->

## Next steps

The next step is up to you! If you want to play around with the example app and learn more about the generated source code: check out the [Project Structure guides](../project-structure/overview.mdx).

If you'd rather start developing your own application, head over to the [Data Modeling guide](./data-modeling.md). After you've finished modeling your application, you can then run the `npm run codegenie:generate` command again to generate the source code.
