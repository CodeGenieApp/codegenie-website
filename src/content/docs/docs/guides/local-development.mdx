## Run the UI Locally

After [deploying to your AWS account](./deployments), start the UI locally by running:

```sh
npm run start:ui
```

Visit localhost:3001 to view your local web app.

## Run the UI and API Locally

If you want to run your UI against a local version of your API, instead run these two commands in separate terminals:

```sh title="Run API Locally"
npm run start:api
```

```sh title="Run UI Locally"
npm run start:ui:offline
```

:::note
This will still use your other cloud resources (e.g. Database and Auth) but allows you to quickly iterate on your UI and API.
