description: Get Started with Code Genie
---

This guide walks you through using the example app to generate your first application with Code Genie, deploying it to your AWS Account, and running it locally for development.

## Prerequisites

Before continuing you'll need an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/) and a developer environment set up with:

- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/setup-aws-cli.html)

## Download and generate example app

:::caution[Coming soon]
Self-service project generation is still under development. Until then, contact brett@codegenie.codes to discuss your project requirements.
:::

{/* *Coming Soon:* Download and unzip example Code Genie App Definition

```sh
Curl + unzip + CD commands
```

```sh
npm i -g @codegenie/generator
npm run @codegenie/generator generate
``` */}

## Deploy to AWS

Install dependencies and deploy to your AWS account by running:

```sh
npm run init:dev
```

See [Deployments: Deploy to AWS](./deployments#deploy-to-aws) for more details.

## Local development

After deploying to your developer AWS account, start the UI locally by running:

```sh
npm run start:ui
```

You can then visit localhost:3001 to view your local web app and begin making changes.

See [Local Development](./local-development) for more details.

## Next steps

The next step is up to you! If you want to play around with the example app and learn more about the generated source code: check out the [Project Walkthrough guides](../project-walkthrough/overview).

If you'd rather start developing your own application, head over to the [App Definition and Data Modeling guide](../spec/app-definition).
