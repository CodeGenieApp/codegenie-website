## Setup AWS CLI Credentials Profiles

Create AWS Credentials Profiles in `~/.aws/credentials` for the stages to which you want to deploy. Usually this will just be a `dev` profile, but you may want to create `staging` and `prod` profiles when setting those environments up for the first time.

```
//~/.aws/credentials
[my-app-name_dev]
aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXX

[my-app-name_staging]
aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXX

[my-app-name_prod]
aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXX
```
:::note
The profile name should be a `kebab-cased` version of the application name, followed by the environment name shorthand (`_dev`, `_staging`, `_prod`). See the `profile` values in `packages/cdk/cdk.json` for the exact values.
:::

:::tip[Use separate AWS Accounts for each stage]
It's recommended to use separate AWS Accounts for each stage for improved security and stability. However, if you prefer to use a single AWS Account for simplicity you can specify the same values for all profiles.

## Deploy to AWS

Install dependencies and deploy to AWS by running:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="dev">
```sh title="Initial install and deploy"
npm i
npm run deploy:dev
npm run deploy:dev # Run deploy a second time during intial setup
npm run copy-outputs-to-dotenv
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="staging">
```sh title="Initial install and deploy"
npm i
npm run deploy:staging
npm run deploy:staging # Run deploy a second time during intial setup
npm run copy-outputs-to-dotenv
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="prod">
```sh title="Initial install and deploy"
npm i
npm run deploy:prod
npm run deploy:prod # Run deploy a second time during intial setup
npm run copy-outputs-to-dotenv
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
The UI isn't deployed on the first run of the `deploy` command because it has dependencies on several cloud resources such as Cognito (Auth) and API Gateway (API). The second run of `npm run deploy:*` is required only during the initial setup, and subsequent changes can be deployed with a single `npm run deploy:*`.

## CI/CD

Code Genie leverages GitHub Actions to implement a Continuous Integration/Deployment Pipeline. When a Pull Request is merged to the main branch (or when changes are pushed directly to it), a workflow is kicked off that:

1. Runs unit tests
1. Deploys the changes to staging
1. Runs integration/end-to-end tests against staging
1. Bumps the version based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
1. Creates a versioned, immutable release artifact and changelog
1. Deploys the release to production

:::caution[Only deploy to prod via CI/CD]
Once your app is live, it's recommended that you **only** deploy to **staging** and **production** via CI/CD. However, deploying to these stages from your local environment is easier when you're first getting them set up, and can also be faster (though less safe) to get a fix out in an emergency.
