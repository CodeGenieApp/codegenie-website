import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Initial deployment

Code Genie apps include a simple command to enable one-command setup:

```sh
npm run init:dev
```

This command does the following:

1. Installs NPM dependencies (`npm i`)
1. Creates a new entry in the [AWS Credentials File](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) `~/.aws/credentials` called `your-app-name_dev` using credentials copied from the `default` profile.
1. [Bootstraps CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html) in the AWS account (`cdk bootstrap`)
1. Deploys to AWS (`npm run deploy:dev`)
1. Copies CloudFormation/CDK outputs to local `.env` files for running the UI and API locally.
1. Opens the live version of the web app in your browser.

:::caution[Email Verification]
If you specify an email address in `cdk.json` (e.g. `verifyUserEmail`, `organizationInviteEmail`, `sandboxApprovedToEmails`), you will receive an email from SES in that email's inbox. You **MUST** click the link in that email for the deployment to complete.
:::

:::tip[AWS Profiles]
If you'd rather copy credentials from a different profile, run `COPY_AWS_PROFILE=profile-name-to-copy npm run init:dev`.

Alternatively, if you'd rather manually define the profiles, run `COPY_AWS_PROFILE=0 npm run init:dev`. The profile name must be a `kebab-cased` version of the application name, followed by the environment name shorthand (`_dev`, `_staging`, `_prod`). See the `profile` values in `packages/cdk/cdk.json` for the exact values.
:::

:::note
Since the UI has a dependency on Cognito and the API, this setup command actually runs deploy a second time.

## Deploying updates

After the initial deployment, you can deploy changes to AWS with:

```sh
npm run deploy:dev
```

## Deploying to staging and production

Similar commands exist for `staging` and `prod`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="dev">
```sh title="Initial install and deploy for dev"
npm run init:dev
npm run deploy:dev
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="staging">
```sh title="Initial install and deploy for staging"
npm run init:staging
npm run deploy:staging
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="prod">
```sh title="Initial install and deploy for prod"
npm run init:prod
npm run deploy:prod
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip[Use separate AWS Accounts for each stage]
It's recommended to use separate AWS Accounts for each stage for improved security and stability. However, if you prefer to use a single AWS Account for simplicity you can specify the same `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` for all 3 profiles.
