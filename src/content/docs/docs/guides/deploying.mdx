## Setup AWS CLI Credentials Profiles

Create AWS Credentials Profiles in `~/.aws/credentials` for the stages to which you want to deploy. Usually this will just be a `dev` profile, but you may want to create `staging` and `prod` profiles when setting those environments up for the first time.

```
//~/.aws/credentials
[my-app-name_dev]
aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXX

[my-app-name_staging]
aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXX

[my-app-name_prod]
aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXX
```
:::note
The profile name should be a `kebab-cased` version of the application name, followed by the environment name shorthand (`_dev`, `_staging`, `_prod`). See the `profile` values in `packages/cdk/cdk.json` for the exact values.
:::

:::tip[Use separate AWS Accounts for each stage]
It's recommended to use separate AWS Accounts for each stage for improved security and stability. However, if you really want to use a single AWS Account you can simply specify the same values for all profiles.

## Deploy to AWS

Install dependencies and deploy to AWS by running:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="dev">
```sh title="Initial install and deploy"
npm i
npm run deploy:dev
npm run deploy:dev # Run deploy a second time during intial setup
npm run copy-outputs-to-dotenv
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="staging">
```sh title="Initial install and deploy"
npm i
npm run deploy:staging
npm run deploy:staging # Run deploy a second time during intial setup
npm run copy-outputs-to-dotenv
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="prod">
```sh title="Initial install and deploy"
npm i
npm run deploy:prod
npm run deploy:prod # Run deploy a second time during intial setup
npm run copy-outputs-to-dotenv
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
The UI isn't deployed on the first run of the `deploy` command because it has dependencies on several cloud resources such as Cognito (Auth) and API Gateway (API). The second run of `npm run deploy:*` is required only during the initial setup, and subsequent changes can be deployed with a single `npm run deploy:*`.
:::

## CI/CD

Code Genie uses GitHub Actions for running tests, creating immutable release artifacts, and deploying to AWS.

:::caution[Deploy using CI/CD]
It's recommended that you only deploy to **staging** and **production** via CI/CD after your app is live. However, deploying to these stages from your local environment is easier when you're first getting them set up, and can also be faster (though less safe) during an emergency.
