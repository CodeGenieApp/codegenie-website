title: Frontend/UI Walkthrough
description: A walkthrough of the Frontend/UI
---

Code Genie projects include a Single Page Application (SPA) Web App, including pages, components, and API integrations for all Entities defined in your [App Definition](../spec/app-definition).

This guide will cover everything you need to know to build, deploy, and extend your application's front end.

## Core Technology

The web app utilizes the following core technologies:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Enables simple bundling, routing, and other benefits when building React applications
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) - A powerful, flexible, and stylable React component library
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/) - Simplifies state management when making API calls
- [AWS Amplify Client Library](https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-js/api/index.html) - Provides client side integration for Cognito Auth
- [AWS Amplify Hosting](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/hosting/) - Hosts our web app

## Commands

After deploying the app to your developer AWS account, start the UI locally with:

```sh
npm run start:ui
```

If you want to run your UI against a local version of your API, instead run these two commands in separate terminals:

```sh
npm run start:api
```

```sh
npm run start:ui:offline
```

Note that this will still use your other cloud resources (e.g. Database and Auth) but allows you to quickly iterate on your UI and API.

## Project Structure Overview

The frontend package exists within the `./packages/ui` directory.

## Pages

Pages are defined using the [Next.js file-system based router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing). They're lightweight React Components that defer most of their functionality to other Components such as Table, CardList, and Form. Pages themselves are primarily responsible for:

- Setting the page title
- Rendering breadcrumbs
- Rendering high-level page layout (positioning of other components)

### Standard Pages

<FileTree>
- pages
  - _app.tsx
  - _document.tsx
  - 404.tsx
  - account.tsx
  - forgot-password.tsx
  - index.tsx login
  - register.tsx
  - reset-password.tsx
  - verify-account.tsx
</FileTree>

`_app.tsx` is the main entry point of your application. It renders the `AppWrapper` component which is responsible for initializing several core libraries and the global layout. See the `AppWrapper` component detailed in [Standard Components](#standard-components) below and the [Next.js Custom App guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) for more information.

`_document.tsx` allows you to customize the outter document such as `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` sections. Read [Next.js Custom Document](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-document) for more details.

`404.tsx` is used to create a custom 404 page. See [Next.js Custom Errors](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error) for more information on customizing 404 and 500 pages.

`account.tsx` renders an Account page that lets you edit account details such as username and avatar.

Other standard pages include authentication flows such as login, register, forgot password, reset password, and verify account.

### Generated Entity Pages

<FileTree>
- pages
  - widgets list page
    - [widgetId] details page
      - relatedWidgets
        - [relatedWidgetId] related details page
            - index.tsx
      - index.tsx
    - index.tsx
</FileTree>

Pages are generated for each Entity defined in your [App Definition](../spec/app-definition). The following pages are generated per entity:

- `/widgets` - A list page for listing all of the records for the Entity. This can be presented as either a Table or a Card List. See [listView](../spec/app-definition#uilistview).
- `/widgets/[widgetId]` - A details page for presenting information on a single record, including direct record properties, as well as related entities/records.
- `/widgets/[widgetId]/related-widget/[relatedWidgetId]` - Similar to the above details page.

:::tip[Did you know?]
You can choose to not generate the details page by marking the Entity with:

```yaml
// .codegenie/entities/Widget.yaml
x-codeGenie
  buildDetailsPage: false
```

It's recommended you do this for entities that are "simple"; i.e. entities that have few properties and no child relationships.
:::

:::tip[Did you know?]
You can set the [listView](../spec/app-definition#uilistview) setting on an Entity to change the list presentation of records. This setting affects both the list page as well as how they're presnted on the details page of a parent record.

```yaml
// .codegenie/entities/Widget.yaml
x-codeGenie
  ui:
    listView: CARD_LIST
```

It's recommended to use `CARD_LIST` when:

- There are likely to be few records on the page
- Users likely won't want to compare values between records (vertical scanning of columns)
- Users likely won't want to sort/filter

## Components

### Standard Components

<FileTree>
- components
  - Me
    - MeData.tsx
    - MeDetails.tsx
    - meHooks.tsx
    - MeUpsertModal.tsx
  - User
    - UserData.tsx
    - UserDeleteModal.tsx
    - UserDetails.tsx
    - UserUpsertModal.tsx
    - UsersTable.tsx
    - userHooks.ts
  - layouts
    - SideMenu.tsx
    - UnauthenticatedLayout.tsx
  - AppWrapper.tsx
  - AvatarNameLink.tsx
</FileTree>

Components and hooks for the current signed in user and other users of the system exist under `./components/Me/` and `./components/User/` respectively. These files follow a similar pattern to their generated equivalents and will be covered below.

`layouts/SideMenu` renders navigation links for the top-level pages of the application.

`layouts/UnauthenticatedLayout` is a wrapper component that includes styles for unauthenticated pages such as login, register, forgot password, etc.

`AppWrapper` is responsible for initializing Auth, HTTP Client, Theme, React Query, and Global Layout. It also checks whether the user is currently logged in and either shows the requested page or the login page.

`AvatarNameLink` is a component that renders an image + name pair. If no image exists, it renders the first characters of the first and last words of the name.

### Generated Entity Components

<FileTree>
- components
  - Widget
    - WidgetData.tsx
    - WidgetDeleteModal.tsx
    - WidgetDetails.tsx
    - WidgetUpsertModal.tsx
    - AppsCardList.tsx
    - widgetHooks.ts
</FileTree>

## Branding and themes

<FileTree>
- themes
  - base.ts
  - dark.ts
  - global.css
  - light.ts
  - theme-provider.ts
  - themes.ts
</FileTree>

You can specify a logo and a primary brand color in your App Definition, and Code Genie will incorporate those into your generated project. See [theme.yaml](../spec/app-definition#themeyaml) and [logo.png](../spec/app-definition#logopng) in the App Definition spec for more details.

Your project includes Dark and Light themes. You can customize themes further to match your branding by modifying the design tokens in `./packages/ui/themes/base.ts`. See [Ant Design's Customize Theme Guide](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme) for more information.
