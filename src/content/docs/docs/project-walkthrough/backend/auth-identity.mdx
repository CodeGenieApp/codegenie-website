Code Genie projects use [Cognito User Pools](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) to handle User Identity.

The API Gateway API is configured with a Cognito Authorizer.

:::note
The User Pool only stores user information required for authentication. All other user data should be stored in the `User` [DynamoDB Table](./database).
