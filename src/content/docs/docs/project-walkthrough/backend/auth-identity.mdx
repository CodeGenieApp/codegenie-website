Currently only email registration is supported out-of-the-box, with SSO (social signin and SAML) support coming soon. For now, developers can implement SSO themselves by following the [Adding social identity providers to a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-social-idp.html) AWS guide.

:::note
The User Pool only stores user information required for authentication. All other user data should be stored in the `User` [DynamoDB Table](./database).
