Code Genie backends are comprised of the following key services:

1. A Serverless Express REST API hosted on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) and [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway).
1. An infinitely scalable Serverless Database using [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb).
1. User identity/authentication via [AWS Cognito User Pool](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito).

This guide covers everything you need to know to build, deploy, and extend your application's backend.

## Core Technology

The backend utilizes the following core services, libraries, and frameworks:

- [Express]() &ndash; The most popular API Framework in Node.js.
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) &ndash; Serverless compute for running the Express REST API.
- [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway) &ndash; Provides HTTPS access to Lambda and ensures requests are authenticated with a valid access token from Cognito.
- [AWS Cognito User Pool](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito) &ndash; Handles user identity/authentication.
- [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb) &ndash; Infinitely scalable database.
- [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses) &ndash; Sends transactional emails, such as those needed by auth flows (register, verify, forgot password, etc.).
- [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html) &ndash; Infrastructure as Code for all of the AWS services used.
- [Serverless Express](https://github.com/brettstack/serverless-express) &ndash; Enables Express to run on Serverless services (API Gateay and Lambda).
- [DynamoDB Toolbox](https://github.com/jeremydaly/dynamodb-toolbox) &ndash; Simplifies querying and updating DynamoDB.
- [Winston]() &ndash; Advanced logging including structured logging, log levels, and more.
