You can specify a logo and a primary brand color in your App Definition, and Code Genie will incorporate those into your generated project.

## Theme

Your project includes Dark and Light themes, and you can customize themes further to match your branding by modifying the design tokens in `./packages/ui/themes/base.ts`. See [Ant Design's Customize Theme Guide](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme) for more information.

See [theme.yaml](../spec/app-definition#themeyaml) in the App Definition spec for more details.

## Icons

Code Genie generates icons of various sizes and formats for you to use in different environments, including icons for:

- Browser favicon
- Android
- Iphone
- Windows

See [logo.png](../spec/app-definition#logopng) in the App Definition spec for more details.
