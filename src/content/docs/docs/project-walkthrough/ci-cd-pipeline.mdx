Code Genie leverages GitHub Actions to implement a Continuous Integration/Deployment Pipeline. When a Pull Request is merged to the main branch (or when changes are pushed directly to it), a workflow is kicked off that:

1. Runs unit tests
1. Deploys the changes to staging
1. Runs integration/end-to-end tests against staging
1. Bumps the version based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
1. Creates a versioned, immutable release artifact and changelog
1. Deploys the release to production

:::caution[Only deploy to prod via CI/CD]
Once your app is live, it's recommended that you **only** deploy to **staging** and **production** via CI/CD. However, deploying to these stages from your local environment is easier when you're first getting them set up, and can also be faster (though less safe) to get a fix out in an emergency.
