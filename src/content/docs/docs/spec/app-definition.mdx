Code Genie generates source code based on your application's data model (or Entity Relationship Model).

It's recommended to import type definitions from the `@codegenie/cli` package (`npm i -D @codegenie/cli`) for a better experience when defining your application's data model.

```ts title='.codegenie/app.ts'
import type { AppDefinition } from '@codegenie/cli'

const appDefinition: AppDefinition = {
  name: 'My App',
  ...
}

export default appDefinition
```

The fastest way to get started is to ask Code Genie to generate an initial data model for you by providing a description of what you're trying to build. See the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/guides/getting-started).

## App

### alarmNotificationEmail

Email address to receive notifications when an alarm is triggered.

### apiDomainName

Domain name to use for your API, e.g. api.example.com.

### appDomainName

Domain name to use for your web app, e.g. app.example.com.

### appId

The automatically generated ID of your Code Genie application. All builds/generations will create a Build under this App. If `appId` isn't specified, a new App will be created when you run `generate` and `appId` will be set for you.

### auth

#### identityProviders

A list of Identity Providers supported by your App.

```
identityProviders: [{ providerType: 'Google' }, { providerType: 'SAML' }]
```

### defaultAuthRouteEntity

The name of the Entity to be used as the default/root page when first logging in. For example, if you specify 'Widget', you'll land on the Widget List page. This value must be set to a key defined in `entities`.

### description

A short user-facing description of your application. Added as HTML meta tags for `description`, `og:description`, and `twitter:description`.

### domainName

Your root domain name. Used for sending emails such as User Verification emails.

### entities

A key/value Map where the key is a pascal-cased name of your Entity.

```
entities: {
  MyWidget: {}
}
```

See [Entity](#entity) for more details.

### ignoreOutputPaths

A list of paths to not generate. Useful when you want to re-generate your app but have heavily modified certain files that you don't wish to overwrite.

### name

Name of your application.

### organizationInviteEmail

Only relevant when using the Organization Permission Model. Email address to use when a user invites another user to their organization. e.g. organization-invite@example.com

### permissionModel

The permission model to use.

- `Global`: All users have access to all data within the app. Used for single-tenanted applications such as internal apps.
- `User`: Users can only access their own data.
- `Organization`: Users can only access data within their Organization. An Organization Entity is included with your app, allowing you to invite other Users to your Organization.

### region

The AWS region you want to deploy your app in. Must be set to a valid AWS region, e.g. `us-west-2`.

### theme

#### primaryColor

Your app's primary brand color to use throughout your application. e.g. #579ddd

### verifyUserEmail

Email address to use for sending User verification emails when a user first registers. e.g. verify@example.com

## Entity

Define your aplication's Data Model (or Entity Relationship Model) by specifying `entities`. For each Entity defined, Code Genie generates:

- React/UI Components: List Page, Details Page, Upsert (Create/Edit) Modal, Delete Modal, Table, Card List
- API: Routes and Controllers for Create, Read (List + Get), Update, and Delete (CRUD)
- Database Table
- ... and more

{/* ## description */}

### dynamodb

This is an optional setting for advanced usage only.

#### gsis

Specify GSIs when you need to query data based on a partition other than the Table's `partitionKey`

##### attributes

A list of attributes to project on this partition, or "ALL" (default).

##### name

Name of the GSI

##### partitionKey

Partition Key for this GSI

##### sortKey

Sort Key for this GSI

#### lsis

Specify LSIs when you need to sort the data in a way other than the Table's `sortKey`

##### attributes

A list of attributes to project on this partition, or "ALL" (default).

##### name

Name of the LSI

##### sortKey

Sort Key for this LSI

{/* #### partitionKey

The name of the property to partition data on. If the Entity specifies a `parentEntity`, this defaults to the Parent Entity's ID Property.

#### sortKey

The name of the property to sort data by. If the Entity specifies a `parentEntity`, this defaults to this Entity's ID Property, which by default is a time-sortable randomly generated ID. */}

### parentEntity

If this Entity is a child of another Entity (i.e the other Entity has a one-to-many relationship with this Entity), specify the name/key of that Entity. Entities that have a `parentEntity` are affected in the following ways:

- They don't show up in the main navigation of the UI. Instead, they show up in the details page of their Parent Entity. Their URL routes are nested under their parent, e.g. `/parentEntity/:parentEntityId/childEntity/:childEntityId`.
- Their API routes are nested under their parent, e.g. `/parentEntity/:parentEntityId/childEntity/:childEntityId`. Note that deeply nested entities (i.e Entities that have a Parent Entity that also has a Parent Entity) don't result in deeply nested API routes.
- Their DynamoDB Table has both a `partitionKey` and a `sortKey`. The `partitionKey` is set to the ID Property of the Parent Entity, and the `sortKey` is set to its own ID Property, enabling efficient querying of child records.

### properties

A map of Properties (or "attributes") that this Entity has. Each entry should have a `camelCased` key of the property name.

```
properties: {
  myProperty: {}
}
```

See [Property](#property) for more details.

### ui

#### generateDetailsPage

Whether a Details Page should be generated for this Entity. This is especially useful when an Entity has few properties and no Child Entities (i.e all of the information is easily visible on the List Page).

#### icon

This icon shows up in navigation and breadcrumbs.

#### listView

How the List Page should present the data. Valid options are 'Table' (default), 'List', and 'CardList'.

#### nestedTableEntity

Specify a Child Entity (i.e an Entity that defines this Entity as its `parentEntity`) to add a nested table to each row to list child records.

#### remainOnCurrentPageOnCreate

Remain on the current page instead of navigating to the newly created record's page.

#### showCreatedDateTime

Show the created time of the record in the UI.

#### showEditInCardList

Show an Edit button on each Card in the List.

#### showEditInTable

Show an Edit button on each Row in the Table.


## Property

### type

Must be one of the following:

- `string`: Uses a standard text input in edit views, and displayed as plain text in read views. DynamoDB type: `string`.
- `number`: Uses a number input in edit views. Can use [format](#format) to present as a compact or monetary value in read views. DynamoDB Type: `number`.
- `date`: Uses a date/time picker (depending on [format](#format)) in edit views. Shows as a relative time in read views with the complete date on hover (e.g. 5 days ago). DynamoDB type: `date`.
- `boolean`: Uses a Switch in edit views. Shows 'Yes'/'No' in read views. DynamoDB type: `boolean`.
- `enum`: Uses a single select in edit views. DynamoDB type: `string`.
- `array`: Uses a multi-select in edit views, and a list of Tags/Pills in read views. DynamoDB type: `list`.
- `map`: Often called an "object" or "key:value". Uses a multiline textarea in edit views. DynamoDB type: `map`.
- `image`: Uses a file uploader in edit views, and displays an image in read views. Images are stored as base64 encoded strings in DynamoDB. This will be replaced with storing images in S3 in a future update.

### isIdProperty

The property used to uniquely identify a Record of this Entity. If no property is marked with `isIdProperty`, one is created for you with the format `{entityName}d` (e.g., for an Entity called `Widget`, the property is called `widgetId`). When specifying your own ID property, it's recommended to still follow this format.

### isNameProperty

The property used for a human to identify a Record of this Entity, e.g. a person's name or a list's title. This property is more prominent in the UI in places such as Tables (shown as the first column), Cards (shown in the title), and in search/select components.

### isMainImageProperty

You can mark a property of type `image` as the main image property, e.g. the standard User Entity has a `profilePicture` property. This property will be presented in multiple places next to the record's name property, such as in List Views, Details Views, and when selecting a related record.

### isRequired

Prevent creating/editing a record without setting a value for this property.

### isImmutable

Allow this property to be set during creation of the record, but cannot be udpated/edited later.

### isReadOnly

Cannot be set by the user. Use [defaultValue](#defaultValue) to set a value during creation.

### defaultValue

Default value of this property. The value should match the type of property (.e.g Boolean properties can specify a value of `true` or `false`). Special values include:

- `$now`: Sets the value to `Date.now()`. Only valid for Date properties (`type: 'date'`)
- `$currentUserId`: Sets the value to the current User's ID. Only valid for String properties (`type: 'string'`)

### description

When specified, a tooltip is shown for the field in the edit view with this description.

### format

Some property types allow you to specify a format.

String Properties:

- `email`: Uses an email input in edit views, and an email link in read views.
- `url`: Uses a link in read views.
- `multiline`: Uses a multi-line text area input in edit views, and is given extra space when shown in read views.
- `password`: Uses a password input in edit views.
- `color`: Uses a color picker input in edit views, and shows a color swatch in read views.

Number Properties:

- `compact`: Uses a compact number (e.g. 2.7k) in read views.
- `money`: Similar to `compact` but includes a '$'.

Date Properties:

- `date`: Uses a datepicker input in edit views. Shows as a relative time in read views with the complete date on hover (e.g. 5 days ago). This is the default format for Date Properties.
- `date-time`: Similar to `date`, but includes a time component in the datepicker.
- `time`: Similar to `date`, but only shows a Time picker.
- `timestamp`: Similar to `date`, but the DynamoDB attribute type is set to `number` instead of `date`

### maxLength

String length must be \<= this amount. String Properties only.

### minLength

String length must be >= this amount. String Properties only.

### regexPattern

String must match this pattern. String Properties only.

### min

Value must be at least this amount. Number Properties only.

### max

Value cannot be more than this amount. Number Properties only.

### isInteger

Adds regex to [Upsert Component](/docs/project-walkthrough/frontend/components#upsertmodal) to prevent decimals and sets stepper to 1.

### relatedEntity

Specify an Entity to create a one-to-one relationship. This value must match the name/key of another Entity. String Properties only.
