[Cognito User Pools](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) is an AWS service that provides applications with user identity and auth. This series of articles cover a full stack solution that enables users to sign in with their Email + Password, Google Sign In, or SSO (SAML), and link all methods to the same user within the app:

This article focuses on the Cognito Triggers (Lambda Functions) responsible for handling special logic when users register or sign in.

The complete source code is available by generating a Code Genie app and specifying `'Google'` and `'SAML'` `idp` options:

```sh title="Generate a To-Do List app with Code Genie"
npx @codegenie/cli generate --name "Todo"
--idp 'Google' --idp 'SAML'
--description "A todo list app that lets users create lists and add items to the list. Items should have a title, description, be markable as completed, have a due date, and have an image."
```

[Code Genie](https://codegenie.codes) generates a Full Stack AWS Serverless application based on your own data model, including a React (Next.js) Web App, Serverless Express REST API, DynamoDB Database, and Cognito Auth.

:::note[Terminology]
This example uses both Google Social Sign in, and Google SSO/SAML. So that we don't confuse the two, I'll just refer to the latter as the "SAML" Identity Provider (IDP) going forward. The terms "Federated" and "External" are used interchangeably.
:::

## Cognito Triggers

The core of this solution relies on two Cognito Triggers. The high-level flow looks like this:

1. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-pre-sign-up.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre sign-up Trigger</a> fires when a user signs up using Google, SAML, or Email + Password. It's also triggered when an existing user signs in using a new external identity for the first time (e.g. if a user signs up using SAML and then later signs in using Google SSO with the same email).
    1. If they're signing up with Email + Password, exit.
    1. If they're signing up via Google or SAML and they haven't already signed up using a different method with the same email: a native Cognito User is created for that email.
    1. The External Identity is linked to the native Cognito User for that email.
1. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-pre-token-generation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre token generation Trigger</a> fires on every sign in.
    {/* 1. If this is their first time signing in, a User record is created in DynamoDB. */}
    1. If the user has External Identities linked to their account, the account is marked as verified.

    // Cognito doesn't support linking a new native Cognito User to an existing Federated User, so it must be done now.
    // This approach allows users to use the Forgot Password flow to reset their password and sign in with email + password.
    const newNativeCognitoUser = await createCognitoUser({

      email,
      givenName,
      familyName,

  return cognitoIdpClient.send(new AdminSetUserPasswordCommand({
    Password: password,
    UserPoolId: userPoolId,
    Username: email,
    Permanent: true,
  }))
}
```

This handler starts by checking the `event.triggerSource` to determine if the signup is using an External Identity Provider (e.g. Google) or if it's an Email + Password signup. If the signup is from an Email + Password and the `AUTO_VERIFY_USERS` environment variable is set, the account is automatically verified and confirmed. The user doesn't receive a verification email and is instantly signed in, reducing friction during the critical user registration flow. However, this may result in other issues including not being GDPR compliant, so it's advised to only do this in development/preview environments.

If the signup is from an External Identity Provider we first get the provider name from the `event.userName` property. This property's value looks like `'google_108986458847054040795'`, so we split on _ to get the `providerName` and `providerUserId` (the user's ID within the External IDP). We then lookup `providerUserId` in the `providerNamesLowerCaseLookup` map to get the correct capitalization of the provider which is required by Cognito's `adminLinkProviderForUser` API. This is an unfortunate extra step we're forced to do and it would be great if the Cognito Trigger included the correct capitliazation of the provider name for us. If no matching provider is found within the map, we throw an error.

:::note
Every other resource that I found on this topic suggests simply uppercasing the first character in `providerName`. This works if you're only using the native External IDPs (Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon) but it doesn't work if you have a SAML/OIDC provider and specify a name like `'GoogleSaml'` (which is what we named it in our previous article).
:::

Next we query Cognito for an existing account under that Email, and if one exists we simply link the External IDP account to it. Otherwise, we create a native Cognito User with a random password and then link the External IDP account.

:::note
This approach handles both scenarios: 1) a user first registers with Email + Password and later signs in with Google/SAML; 2) a user first registers with Google/SAML and later tries to sign in with Email + Password.

Cognito doesn't support linking an Email + Password account to an "External" account. By creating a native Cognito account in scenario 2, we enable the user to login with their email address in the future. Ideally, the user would be able to go through the normal Register with Email + Password flow and things would "just work". Unfortunately, they must use the Forgot Password flow to reset their password before they can sign in with this method.

### Pre Token Generation Lambda Handler
```typescript title='packages/cognito/cognito-pre-token-generation.ts'
import { AdminUpdateUserAttributesCommand, CognitoIdentityProviderClient } from '@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider'
import axios from 'axios'
import type { PreTokenGenerationTriggerEvent } from 'aws-lambda'
import { createUser, getUser, updateUser } from '../api/controllers/user'
import { StringMap } from '../common/types'
import getFullName from './getFullName'

const cognitoIdpClient = new CognitoIdentityProviderClient({ region: 'us-west-2' })

interface Identity {
  providerType: 'Google' | 'Facebook' | 'SAML' | 'OIDC' | string
}

export async function handler (event: PreTokenGenerationTriggerEvent) {
  const {
    userPoolId,
    userName,
    request: {
      userAttributes,
    },
  } = event
  const promises: Promise<any>[] = [syncUserToDynamo(userAttributes)]

  const { identities, email } = userAttributes

  if (email && identities) {
    const identitiesArray: Identity[] = JSON.parse(identities)
    const hasExternalIdentity = identitiesArray.some(identity => ['Google', 'Facebook', 'SAML', 'OIDC'].includes(identity.providerType))

    if (hasExternalIdentity) {
      // Cognito has a "feature" that sets all attributes to their default values when not present on the external identity provider.
      // This results in the email_verified being set to false on each login, which causes features like forgot password to not work.
      // Force it back to email_verified=true.
      promises.push(setUserEmailVerifiedTrue({
        userPoolId,
        username: userName,
      }))
    }
  }

  await Promise.all(promises)

  return event
}

async function setUserEmailVerifiedTrue ({
  userPoolId,
  username,
}: {
  userPoolId: string
  username: string
}) {
  return cognitoIdpClient.send(new AdminUpdateUserAttributesCommand({
    UserPoolId: userPoolId,
    Username: username,
    UserAttributes: [{Name: 'email_verified', Value: 'true'}],
  }))
}

async function syncUserToDynamo (userAttributes: StringMap) {
  const {
    sub: userId,
    email,
    given_name: givenName,
    family_name: familyName,
    name,
    picture,
  } = userAttributes

  const fullName = getFullName({ name, givenName, familyName })
  const existingUser = await getUser({ userId })

  if (existingUser) {
    // If the user doesn't have an avatar set and one is available from the external IDP: set it to the user's avatar
    // NOTE: Uploading user avatar to S3 instead of storing the base64 in DynamoDB is a better solution.
    if (picture && !existingUser.data.avatar) {
      const base64EncodedProfilePicture = await fetchAndBase64EncodeImage(picture)
      await updateUser({ userId, user: { avatar: base64EncodedProfilePicture }})
    }
    return
  }

  const user: any = {
    name: fullName,
    email,
  }

  if (picture) {
    const base64EncodedProfilePicture = await fetchAndBase64EncodeImage(picture)

    if (base64EncodedProfilePicture) {
      user.avatar = base64EncodedProfilePicture
    }
  }

  return createUser({ userId, user })
}

async function fetchAndBase64EncodeImage(imageUrl) {
  try {
    const image = await axios.get(imageUrl, {responseType: 'arraybuffer'})
    const base64 = Buffer.from(image.data).toString('base64')
    return base64 ? `data:image/png;base64, ${base64}` : null
  } catch(error: unknown) {
    // If we encounter an error while fetching/encoding the image, it's better to just log and continue.
    // The user won't have their profile picture, but at least they'll be registered/logged in!
    console.error('cognito.preTokenGeneration.syncUserToDynamo.fetchAndBase64EncodeImage.error', {
      errorName: (error as Error).name,
      errorMessage: (error as Error).message,
    })
  }
}
```

This handler's primary purposes are to create a user record in DynamoDB if one doesn't exist (`syncUserToDynamo`), and to ensure the Cognito user remains verified (`setUserEmailVerifiedTrue`). Both operations are executed in parallel to improve performance thanks to our `await Promise.all`.

`syncUserToDynamo` queries DynamoDB for a User item with the Cognito User's ID (`event.request.userAttributes.sub`), and if one doesn't exist it's inserted into DynamoDB. If a user already exists but doesn't have a profile picture set and one is available through the sign in method they're using (e.g. they first signed in with Email or SAML which doesn't expose a profile picture, and then signed in with Google), it updates DynamoDB with the profile picture. You could also choose to sync other data here, e.g. if you want to update the user's name or other data to match what's in the External IDP.

If the Cognito User has External Identities linked to it, `setUserEmailVerifiedTrue` is called to force the `email_verified` attribute back to true. There is an unfortunate Cognito "feature" that sets all User attributes to their default value when signing in with an External IDP that doesn't return that value. For `email_verified` this is `false`. We must keep `email_verified=true`, otherwise the user won't be able to sign in with their Email + Password or use the "Forgot Password" flow.

:::tip
It's recommended to store User data in DynamoDB, and let Cognito just handle the auth.

Consider using S3 instead of DynamoDB for storing the user avatar.

:::note
The `createUser, getUser, updateUser` functions are just wrappers around a [DynamoDB Toolbox](https://github.com/jeremydaly/dynamodb-toolbox) User Entity

### getFullName

A small helper function for getting the user's full name from the External IDP when it doesn't support mapping one.

```typescript title='packages/cognito/getFullName.ts'
// Google SAML doesn't allow mapping the full name field, so we instead must construct this ourselves based on Given Name and Family Name.
export default function getFullName({ name, givenName, familyName}) {
  let fullName = name

  // If the name is JUST the given name, AND a family name exists: concatenate them into full name.
  // This is especially useful in Google SAML where it doesn't include a full name attribute.
  if (givenName && familyName && (!fullName || fullName === givenName)) {
    fullName = `${givenName} ${familyName}`
  } else if (!fullName) {
    fullName = givenName || familyName
  }

  return fullName
}
```

## End

Multi-account linking between external identity providers and native Cognito Users isn't simple, but it is possible thanks to Lambda Triggers.
