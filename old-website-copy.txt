Code Genie uses generative AI to design a data model and write source code based on your idea. Download the source code for your full stack application and deploy to AWS in minutes.





A Full Stack, Cloud Native, Serverless Application — Instantly
Code Genie instantly generates a UI, API, Database, Auth, Cloud Infrastructure (IAC) and more based on your idea or data model. The stack consists of these popular languages, libraries, and services:

Built for developers, by developers
We know how important the developer experience is when it comes to writing great software, and that’s why Code Genie’s generated projects are architected with a DX you’re sure to love.

Local Development
Make changes to your UI and API code easily with local development. Actual cloud resources are used for all other infrastructure to emulate a prod-like environment.

CI/CD
Enable the integrated GitHub CI/CD Pipeline to automate deployments of merged changes through to staging and production. PR Preview Stacks can also be enabled for reviewers to easily test changes before approving.

Independent Stacks
As well as Prod and Staging, each developer can easily spin up their own development stack to work in a prod-like environment.

One-Command Deploy
Don’t want to use CI/CD? No problem! You can deploy your changes in a single command from your developer machine.

Infrastructure as Code
All cloud services are instrumented via IAC, ensuring that stacks are repeatable across environments, and changes to infrastructure are version controlled just like your code.

Automated Tests
All generated source code come with unit and end-to-end tests, achieving over 90% test coverage in total.
